    <h2><a name="lovebombing"></a>Is It Love… or Love Bombing?</h2>
    <p><strong>🚩 Red Alert:</strong> When the “I love you” drops before your Starbucks order does, it’s time to pause.</p>
    <p>Let’s be real — love bombing is like getting emotional whiplash. It’s intense, overwhelming, and low-key addictive. At first, it feels like a rom-com montage: constant compliments, rapid-fire texting, big promises (“You’re the one,” “I’ve never felt like this”). But beneath that fairytale haze is something much darker.</p>
    <h3>What is Love Bombing?</h3>
    <p>Psychologists define love bombing as <em>“an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection”</em> (Psychology Today). It’s a classic tactic used by narcissists and emotional abusers to gain control quickly.</p>
    <blockquote>
        “Love bombing is not love. It’s manipulation disguised as affection.” – Dr. Ramani Durvasula
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Real Example</h3>
    <p><strong>Their message:</strong><br>“You’re not like anyone I’ve ever met. I’ve been looking for you my whole life. I want to wake up next to you forever.” (after 5 days of texting)</p>
    <p><strong>Decoded:</strong><br>Intense emotional declarations with zero context = 🚩. This isn’t soulmates, it’s strategy. Emotional intimacy without real-world connection is a manipulation technique — not fate.</p>
    <h3>Why It Works</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>🧠 Our brains release dopamine + oxytocin during high attention = instant bond</li>
        <li>⏱️ It’s designed to move fast — so you don’t have time to think critically</li>
        <li>😢 After the high comes the withdrawal — often used to create dependency</li>
    </ul>

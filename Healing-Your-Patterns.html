                    <p>You swore the last relationship was different. You promised yourself you'd learned your lesson. Yet here you are again, feeling like you're reading from the same script with a different cast.</p>

                    <p>If you keep attracting the same type of person or falling into the same relationship patterns, you're not cursed, unlucky, or "choosing wrong." <strong>You're responding to unconscious programming that was installed long before you ever started dating.</strong></p>

                    <p>Understanding why you repeat these cycles is the first step to breaking them. Let's analyze your relationship patterns and learn how to rewrite the script.</p>

                    <h2>Why We Repeat Relationship Patterns</h2>

                    <p>Your relationship patterns were formed in your earliest experiences of love and attachment. Your nervous system learned what to expect from relationships based on:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How your parents related to each other</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>How your caregivers treated you</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What behavior got you love and attention</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>What happened when you expressed needs or emotions</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Whether love felt safe or conditional</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These early experiences created your "attachment style"—your unconscious blueprint for how relationships work.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> You don't choose your patterns consciously. They're automatic responses your nervous system learned to keep you safe (or get love) in your original environment.</p>

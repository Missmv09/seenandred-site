    <p>Let‚Äôs make this crystal clear: emotionally mature people don‚Äôt confuse you on accident.</p>

    <p>If someone texts you ‚Äúgood morning, beautiful‚Äù one day and then ghosts you for three? That‚Äôs not them being ‚Äúbusy‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs them regulating your expectations, not building a bond.</p>

    <p>Psychologists call this intermittent reinforcement ‚Äî a tactic that keeps you chasing the high of the last nice thing they said while they pull away just enough to keep you off-balance. It's the same cycle casinos use to keep people gambling.</p>

    <p>When communication is inconsistent, so is your nervous system. And if you‚Äôre stuck trying to decode what they meant instead of how you feel ‚Äî that‚Äôs the game. And you're not the player, bestie ‚Äî you're the pawn.</p>

    <div class="cta">
        <p><strong>Real talk:</strong> someone who's serious about you won't keep you in suspense. Let's unpack what your gut already knows.</p>

    <p>You’re not “too sensitive” — you're picking up on real inconsistencies. One day they're obsessed, the next they’re distant? 🚩 That’s not passion, that’s a control tactic.</p>

    <p>Hot-and-cold behavior keeps you emotionally dysregulated — constantly questioning what *you* did wrong. But newsflash: emotionally mature people don’t create confusion.</p>

    <p>It’s called **intermittent reinforcement** — a psychological tactic often seen in narcissistic dynamics. It creates addiction-like effects by mixing affection with rejection. Basically: a mindf*ck.</p>

    <p>If someone can only show up when it's convenient or when you pull away, that’s not growth — it’s manipulation dressed up as “mystery.”</p>

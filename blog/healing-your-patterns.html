<p>We don’t only date with logic—we date with our nervous system. Attachment styles and trauma bonds can make chaos feel like chemistry. The goal isn’t to shame your past; it’s to understand the wiring so you can pick partners who match your <em>needs</em>, not your wounds.</p>

<h2>Why Patterns Feel So “Right”</h2>
<p><strong>Attachment theory</strong> (Bowlby, Ainsworth) explains how early experiences shape our expectations of closeness. If attention was inconsistent, intermittent reinforcement can make hot–cold dynamics feel exciting. <strong>Trauma bonding</strong> pairs emotional pain with relief; the brain starts chasing relief instead of health.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Reframe:</strong> “Familiar” isn’t the same as “safe.” Your body is voting for what it recognizes—not always what you need.</blockquote>

<h2>The Pattern Triangle</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong> — loneliness, attraction, anxiety.<br><em>Text you might send:</em> “Hey… did I do something? You didn’t reply 😞.”</li>
<li><strong>Story</strong> — “If I try harder, I’ll be chosen.”<br><em>Red flag reply:</em> “If you really loved me, you’d answer faster.”<br><em>Green flag reply:</em> “I know you’re busy — text me when you can.”</li>
<li><strong>Behavior</strong> — over‑investing, ignoring flags, shrinking needs.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Red vs. Green Text Examples</h2>
<div class="codebox">
<p><strong>Red flags</strong></p>
<p>• “You’re too sensitive, it was just a joke 🙄.”</p>
<p>• “You never do enough for me.”</p>
<p>• “Stop overreacting, you always make drama.”</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Green flags</strong></p>
<p>• “Thanks for telling me — I want to get it right next time.”</p>
<p>• “Running late, but I’m excited to see you. Coffee on me?”</p>
<p>• “I need solo time tonight, but I’ll call you tomorrow.”</p>
</div>

<h2>Reset in Three Lanes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Body:</strong> 4‑7‑8 breathing, quick walk, cold splash before texting.</li>
<li><strong>Boundary:</strong> One‑line standard: “I don’t chase; I invite.”</li>
<li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Replace pursuit with clarity: “I feel confused when I don’t hear back. Are you available for this connection?”</li>
</ul>

<div class="kit">
<h3>Replacement Habits (30‑Day Rewire)</h3>
<ul>
<li>48‑hour rule before escalating intimacy.</li>
<li>Two‑text max if they’re inconsistent; then pause.</li>
<li>Sunday review: three <em>green</em> flags you saw this week.</li>
<li>Save the story; judge the pattern.</li>
<li>Choose steady‑safe over thrilling‑chaotic for 90 days.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2>When to Walk</h2>
<ul>
<li>They repeat the same wound after one clean request.</li>
<li>They dismiss or mock your boundary.</li>
<li>You spend more time monitoring than connecting.</li>
</ul>

<section aria-labelledby="faq-hyp" style="margin-top:24px">
  <h2 id="faq-hyp">FAQ: Healing Patterns</h2>
  <details><summary>How do I know if it’s a trauma bond or just chemistry?</summary>
    <p>Check the cycle: extreme highs/lows, fear of withdrawal, and relief after chaos point to trauma bonds. Calm consistency feels less dramatic but is healthier long-term.</p>
  </details>
  <details><summary>Can anxious and avoidant partners work out?</summary>
    <p>Yes, with awareness and repair. Look for predictable plans, open check-ins, and boundaries both partners honor.</p>
  </details>
  <details><summary>What first step breaks the pattern fastest?</summary>
    <p>Replace pursuit with clarity: make one clean request, then watch behavior over words.</p>

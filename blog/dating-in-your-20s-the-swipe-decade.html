    <p>Dating apps turned the hunt for connection into a thumb workout. Options feel endless, but so does the confusion. Here's how twenty‑somethings can move through the swipe decade with their sanity intact.</p>

    <h2>Situationships</h2>
    <p>The “what are we?” limbo is a favorite in this decade. If you find yourself on the edge of something more, ask for clarity early. Your time isn’t a trial period; it’s an investment.</p>

    <h2>Rosters</h2>
    <p>Keeping a lineup can feel safe, but juggling hearts is exhausting. If you’re dating multiple people, be transparent and check your motives—are you exploring or avoiding?</p>

    <h2>Clarity Over Chaos</h2>
    <p>Whether it’s a chatty match or a slow burn, set simple boundaries: how often you talk, how soon you meet, what you want. Clear is kind, even when feelings are casual.</p>

    <p><em>Swipe with intention, show up with integrity, and remember—the goal isn’t more matches, it’s a better match.</em></p>

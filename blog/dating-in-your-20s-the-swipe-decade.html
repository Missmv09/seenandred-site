    <p>I couldn’t help but wonder… is dating in your 20s about love, or just about logistics—who’s free, who’s fun, and who’s two blocks away on Bumble?</p>
    <p>In your 20s, dating is an endless scroll. Apps like Tinder and Hinge turn people into trading cards, and the rush of the match often outweighs the actual connection.</p>

    <h2>The New Dating Trends</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situationships &amp; “Talking Stages”</strong>: low-definition connections; why ambiguity feels safer than labels.</li>
      <li><strong>Rostering</strong>: casual parallel dating as “options.”</li>
      <li><strong>Micro-dosing intimacy</strong>: voice notes, memes, soft-launching on IG stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Offline revival</strong>: book clubs, gym meetups, coworking mixers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Mental Health Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Comparison culture</strong>: couple content envy → self-doubt.</li>
      <li><strong>Ghosting anxiety</strong>: unpredictable exits mess with attachment styles.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance pressure</strong>: curated digital identity vs. authentic self.</li>
      <li><strong>FOMO</strong>: every “missed match” feels like missing out on love.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Men vs. Women in the 20s Dating Game</h2>
    <p><strong>Women</strong>: independence first, looking for safety + green flags.<br>
    <strong>Men</strong>: stuck between “don’t catch feelings” culture and the call for emotional maturity.<br>
    <strong>Both</strong>: text chemistry doesn’t always translate IRL.</p>

    <h2>What Healthy Looks Like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Define your dating goals in one sentence and share them early.</li>
      <li>Two-app max; delete/reinstall in 30-day cycles.</li>
      <li>“Three-date rule” for clarity: interest, values, logistics.</li>
      <li>Set micro-boundaries: “No last-minute plans,” “No midnight texts.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Attention is easy. Presence is rare. In your 20s, the boldest move isn’t swiping right—it’s showing up, fully, for someone who shows up back.</em></p>

    <p>I couldn’t help but wonder… is dating in your 20s about love, or logistics—who’s free, who’s fun, and who’s two blocks away on Bumble? In the swipe decade, people become profiles, and the dopamine rush of a match can feel like connection. But attention isn’t intimacy. And the difference is where your heart learns the hard way.</p>

    <h2>The 20s Dating Landscape</h2>
    <p>Your 20s are a laboratory: new cities, new jobs, new versions of yourself. Commitment competes with exploration. For many, “defining the relationship” feels riskier than a 1 a.m. meet-up. The default mode is optionality: keep things casual, keep doors open, keep feelings… negotiable.</p>

    <h2>Trends That Shape the Decade</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Situationships &amp; the “talking stage”</strong> — romantic purgatory where nothing is labeled and everything is implied.</li>
      <li><strong>Rostering</strong> — parallel casual dating managed like a fantasy league; exciting, but often shallow.</li>
      <li><strong>Micro-dosing intimacy</strong> — memes, voice notes, late-night confessions without daytime consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Soft-launching</strong> — shadowy shoulders on Instagram, a teaser before the reveal.</li>
      <li><strong>Offline revival</strong> — swipe fatigue sends people to hobby groups, mixers, and IRL community.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mental Health in the Swipe Era</h2>
    <p>Gen Z and young millennials report record anxiety and low mood. Dating apps can amplify that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Comparison loops</strong> — curated couple feeds seed inadequacy and fear you’re “behind.”</li>
      <li><strong>Ghosting &amp; breadcrumbing</strong> — intermittent reinforcement dysregulates your nervous system.</li>
      <li><strong>Performance pressure</strong> — curated digital self vs. authentic self; “be chill” becomes emotional suppression.</li>
      <li><strong>FOMO economics</strong> — every unmatched swipe feels like a missed fate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Attachment Patterns You’ll Notice</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Anxious</strong> — read receipts as vital signs; ambiguity feels like rejection.</li>
      <li><strong>Avoidant</strong> — “options open,” intimacy deferred; connection is postponed by busyness.</li>
      <li><strong>Earned secure</strong> — clarity, reciprocity, and pacing on purpose.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gendered Experiences</h2>
    <p><strong>Women</strong> foreground safety and boundaries while filtering for green flags amid performative “cool girl” pressure. <strong>Men</strong> navigate a culture of “don’t catch feelings” while being asked for emotional fluency. Both collide with mismatched expectations: text chemistry that dies IRL, or great dates that vanish into silence.</p>

    <h2>Red, Yellow, Green Flags (20s Edition)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Green</strong> — consistent communication, explicit intentions, respect for boundaries, plans in advance.</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow</strong> — “bad texter” + no effort to plan; soft ghosting; future talk with zero follow-through.</li>
      <li><strong>Red</strong> — love-bombing &rarr; devalue cycle, triangulation, chronic ambiguity, boundary pushing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>First-Date Playbook</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Daylight coffee walk (90 minutes max) — chemistry without performance.</li>
      <li>Bookstore browse + quick café debrief — values without interrogation.</li>
      <li>Thrift or mini-golf challenge — play reveals character faster than interviews.</li>
      <li>Friend-adjacent hang (low-stakes group event) — safer, pressure-light.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scripts for Clarity (Copy/Paste)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pacing</strong>: “I like to meet within a week so we don’t build a fantasy. Coffee next Tuesday?”</li>
      <li><strong>Intentions</strong>: “I’m open to something real if it feels mutual. What are you looking for this year?”</li>
      <li><strong>Exit kindly</strong>: “You’re lovely; I don’t feel a fit. Wishing you the best.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Healthy Looks Like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>State your goal in one sentence and share it early (casual, exploring, relationship-minded).</li>
      <li>Two-app max; uninstall when burnt out; return with intention.</li>
      <li>Three-date rule: interest, values, logistics must align.</li>
      <li>Micro-boundaries: “No last-minute plans,” “No midnight texts,” “I need 24h notice.”</li>
      <li>Choose presence over attention — the real flex is consistency.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>Attention is easy. Presence is rare. In your 20s, the bravest move isn’t swiping right — it’s staying when it’s right.</em></p>

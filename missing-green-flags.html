                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>You know that feeling when someone treats you well, but something inside you feels... uncomfortable? Like waiting for the other shoe to drop, or finding reasons why their kindness "doesn't count"? You're not broken. Your nervous system is just wired for chaos, not calm.</p>

                    <p>Here's the truth nobody talks about: <strong>sometimes our biggest relationship problem isn't missing red flags—it's missing green ones.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Why Green Flags Feel Wrong</h2>

                    <p>When you've been conditioned by inconsistent love, drama, or emotional unavailability, healthy behavior can feel foreign. Your nervous system has been trained to recognize love through:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Intensity</strong> instead of consistency</li>
                        <li><strong>Anxiety</strong> instead of peace</li>
                        <li><strong>Chasing</strong> instead of being chosen</li>
                        <li><strong>Chaos</strong> instead of stability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>Real talk:</strong> If healthy love feels "boring," that's your trauma talking, not your intuition.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Green Flags You're Probably Missing</h2>

                    <h3>1. Consistent Communication</h3>
                    <p>They text back in reasonable time. No games, no three-day rules, no mixed signals. But if you're used to breadcrumbing, this might feel "too easy" or make you question their interest.</p>

                    <h3>2. They Show Up When They Say They Will</h3>
                    <p>Plans aren't tentative suggestions. They arrive on time, do what they promise, and don't leave you guessing about their intentions. Revolutionary concept, right?</p>

                    <h3>3. They're Interested in Your Life</h3>
                    <p>Not just surface-level questions. They remember details from previous conversations, ask follow-up questions, and genuinely want to know you—not just what you can do for them.</p>

                    <h3>4. Conflict Doesn't Mean Combat</h3>
                    <p>When disagreements happen, they don't yell, storm out, or give silent treatment. They actually try to understand your perspective and work toward solutions. Wild, we know.</p>

                    <h3>5. They Respect Your Boundaries</h3>
                    <p>You say no to something, and they... accept it? Without guilt-tripping, negotiating, or pushing back? Without making you explain yourself seventeen times? Yes, this is how it should work.</p>

                    <div class="cta-section">
                        <h3>Confused About Mixed Signals?</h3>

                    <h2>Why Your Brain Rejects Green Flags</h2>

                    <p>Your subconscious is running on old programming. If love in your family looked like:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Having to earn affection through performance</li>
                        <li>Emotional hot and cold treatment</li>
                        <li>Love being conditional on being "good enough"</li>
                        <li>Chaos, drama, or instability feeling normal</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Then healthy, stable love triggers your nervous system's alarm bells. It doesn't match your template for what love "should" feel like.</p>

                    <h2>How to Rewire Your Pattern Recognition</h2>

                    <h3>1. Notice Your Internal Response</h3>
                    <p>When someone treats you well, pause and ask: "Am I rejecting this because it's genuinely wrong for me, or because it feels unfamiliar?"</p>

                    <h3>2. Separate Trauma Responses from Intuition</h3>
                    <p>Trauma responses feel urgent, chaotic, and familiar. Intuition feels calm, clear, and protective. Learn the difference.</p>

                    <h3>3. Practice Tolerating Good Treatment</h3>
                    <p>Start small. Let people be kind to you without immediately looking for the catch. Sit with the discomfort of being valued.</p>

                    <h3>4. Question Your "Requirements" for Love</h3>
                    <p>Do you need someone to chase you to feel wanted? Do you need drama to feel passion? These aren't preferences—they're trauma responses.</p>

                    <div class="highlight-box">
                        <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Healthy love doesn't feel like a drug. It feels like coming home.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                    <p>You deserve someone who shows up consistently, communicates clearly, and treats you with respect—not as a prize to be won or a problem to be solved. If that feels "too good to be true," that's your cue to examine what you've been accepting as normal.</p>

                    <p>Green flags aren't boring. They're revolutionary.</p>

                    <p>Your nervous system might need time to adjust, but you can learn to recognize love that doesn't require you to suffer for it. You can learn to trust calm over chaos.</p>

                    <p>Start paying attention. The right person might already be showing you who they are—you just might need to learn how to see it.</p>

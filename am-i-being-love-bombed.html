    <h1>Am I Being Love Bombed?</h1>
    
            <p>If it feels like a fairy tale on fast-forward—slow down. Love bombing is intensity disguised as intimacy. The late-night texts, the big declarations, the “I’ve never felt this way before” energy… all within days?</p>
            <p>That’s not connection, that’s control dressed up in charm. Healthy love builds over time. Love bombing spikes your dopamine and then pulls the rug out. If you’re already anxious about losing him, ask yourself: what’s the rush?</p>
